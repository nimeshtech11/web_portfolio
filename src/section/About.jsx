            <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600">Nimesh Thakur</span>,
            a passionate and performance-focused{" "}
            <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> with{" "}
            <strong>3 years of professional experience</strong> crafting
            engaging, responsive, and accessible web applications. My journey
            into tech started with a deep curiosity about how websites work â€”
            and today, I specialize in turning design visions into reality using{" "}
            <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and modern JavaScript (ES6+).
          </p>

          <p>
            Iâ€™ve worked extensively in the <strong>EdTech sector</strong>, where
            I built and maintained scalable, high-performance frontends for
            learning platforms. My typical day involves collaborating with UI/UX
            designers, integrating <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, optimizing
            performance through lazy loading and code splitting, and ensuring{" "}
            <strong>pixel-perfect and accessible</strong> experiences across all
            screen sizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond front-end, I also have working knowledge of{" "}
            <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong>, and{" "}
            <strong>MongoDB</strong>, which enables me to better understand
            full-stack flows and troubleshoot more effectively. Iâ€™m confident
            with tools like Git, npm, Webpack, and CI/CD pipelines and sound
            knowledge of testable code using <strong>Jest</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>React Testing Library</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My career didnâ€™t start in code â€” I previously held roles in{" "}
            <strong>content management</strong> and <strong>operations</strong>,
            where I led documentation workflows, streamlined review processes,
            and developed a strong sense of organization and communication. This
            unique background makes me not just a developer â€” but someone who
            understands business processes, team collaboration, and client needs
            holistically.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently based in <strong>Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh</strong>, and
            open to both <strong>full-time roles</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>freelance opportunities</strong>. Iâ€™m driven by clean code,
            great user experience, and continuous learning. Whether Iâ€™m
            debugging a tricky UI issue or collaborating with a team on a
            product launch â€” I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge me
            to grow.
